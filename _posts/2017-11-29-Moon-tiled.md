# Moon picture

Taken with Nikon D200 through 8" f/6.0 Dobsonian with 2x barlow. Image
consists of nine (raw) images merged in the Gimp. Illumination was
82.4%. Transparency was okay; seeing was pretty good.

Stacking images might help, but there would be more issues with field
rotation. As is, all pictures used in this composite image were taken
within the span of about 45 seconds, so the total field rotation over
the course of the images was only about 0.2 degrees (adjusted for in
the Gimp).
