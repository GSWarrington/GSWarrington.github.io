# Moon picture

Taken with Nikon D200 through 8" f/6.0 Dobsonian with 2x barlow. Image
consists of nine (raw) images merged in the Gimp. Illumination was
82.4%. Transparency was okay; seeing was pretty good. In the
embiggened version, craters down to about 6km in diameter are
discernible.

Stacking images might help, but (given my lack of an equatorial mount)
there would be more issues with field rotation. As is, all pictures
used in this composite image were taken within the span of about 45
seconds, so the total field rotation over the course of the images was
only about 0.2 degrees, which is negligible.
