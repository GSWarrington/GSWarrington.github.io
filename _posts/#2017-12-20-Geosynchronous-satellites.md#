# Geosynchronous satellites

This is a 5 minute, f/2, ISO 400 exposure with a 50mm lens (so about
26x18 degrees in FOV) from April 24, 2017. The ridiculously bright
object is Jupiter. The greenish streak bottom middle is reflection of
Jupiter off of the UV filter I forgot to remove from the camera (took
a while to identify the source of this streak). The bright star in the
lower left just clearing the tree is Spica.

There are, I believe, at least eight geosynchronous satellites
captured in the picture.

- Two relatively bright ones to the lower left of Jupiter and
  vertically aligned with the rightmost part of Spica.
- Two much fainter ones vertically aligned with the leftmost part of
  Jupiter.
- A slightly greenish one horizontally aligned with Jupiter.
- A moderately bright one horizontally aligned just above the top of Jupiter.
- Two faint ones near the edge of the frame.

- Parallax
- Identifications
- Resources for where to find?
- Is greenish one from a bad pixel?

Express AMB -- Telstar 12V - 1 d 13' = 182 pixels
Gorizont 11 -- Raduga 16 - 1 d 20'  - Raduga is higher up = 200 pixels
Raduga 16 -- Gorizont 10 - 1 d 29'= 222 pixels

4 stars below jupiter - farther two are 1d 48' = 263 pixels = 2.5 pixels per arcmin
top of 4 (g vir) to theta vir - 3 d 30' = 520 pixels = 2.5 pixels per arcmin

33 pixels - between first two bright ones	13'
312 pixels - to next (faint) pair    		2d 12'
20 pixels - to next in faint pair		8'
410 pixels to singleton	     			2d 44'
417 pixels to next singleton			2d 46'
420 pixels to next pair (1st is faint)		2d 46'
80 to next in pair (much brighter)		32'
340 to a super faint one 			2d 16'
82 to a somewhat brighter			32'
427 pixels to first of pair			2d 50'
17 to next in pair     				7'
