My extension tubes don't have electrical contacts so the lens
automatically shoots wide open (though see below). I wanted to see how
restricting the aperature --- through cardboard masks placed in front
of the lens --- affected the depth of field (DOF). There are formulas
for this but 1) I didn't know how the extension tubes affect the
calculation and 2) it's somewhat subjective. I figured the best thing
to do was just take some pictures and see for myself.

During this project I realized that my extension tubes _don't_
actually let my 50 mm lens open up all of the way. This was pretty
clear once I looked down the lens barrel, but I also checked it by
measuring. The f-stop is the focal length divided by the diameter of
the aperature. Or, equivalently, the aperature is the focal length
divided by the f-stop. My 50 mm lens opens up to f/1.8, so it's
maximum aperature is 27.8 mm. However, after taking some measurements,
it looks like the extension tubes leave the lens with an opening of
about 17mm. You can see what's going on in the below picture where the
extension-tube aperature pin (the round one) is to the left of the
camera-body pin.

Anyway, 17 mm his is about 1 1/3 stops up from f/1.8 and is at
f/2.8. If I"m not going to have electronic control of the aperature,
this is probably a better chocie than f/1.8. At f/1.8, _very_ little
would be in focus. But even at f/2.8, very little is in focus. So I
used a few hole punches we had to make some cardboard masks: One of 3mm and one of 6 mm.

The 6 mm and 3 mm masks lead to ballparks of about f/9 and f/18,
respectively. These a little over 3 stops and a little over 5 stops,
respectively. Below are three shots taken with various aperatures to
test the DOF. These were taken in bright sunlight from an angle of
about 45 degrees to the tape measure. Camera was at minimum focus
distance. From left to right, they are: wide open (f/2.8), 6 mm mask
(f/9) and 3 mm mask (f/18).

I should note that the cardboard masks I made were put on the front of
the lens. Perhaps there is some correction I need to make for this
since the focus distance is so close, but I don't know it and I
optimistically assume it's relatively minor, so will ignore that.

To my eye, there are about 1/16" in reasonably crisp focus for the 3mm
mask, about 1/32" for the 6mm mask and a about 1/64" for the 17 mm
(i.e., no) mask. (Of course, since we're viewing the tape at a 45
degree angle, the absolute DOFs are about 70 percent of these depths.)
But stopping down the lens doesn't simply increase the range that's in
relatively crisp focus, it also slows down the rate at which the focus
deteriorates outside of this range. I suppose this isn't surprising,
but it is important. At 3mm, you can discern the tick marks across the
whole range. With no mask, you can follow the tick marks for at most
one-third of what's visible.
