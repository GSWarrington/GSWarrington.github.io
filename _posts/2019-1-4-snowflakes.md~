# First snowflake photos

Here are the first two photographs of snowflakes I've taken that have
any claim to being "macro".

# Imaging setup

I used a handheld Nikon D200 with a 50mm f/1.8 lens and three
extension tubes totalling 65mm. The extension tubes don't have any
electrical connectors so the lens was wide open since it doesn't have
an aperature ring. There was also no metering (i.e., manual
exposures). The flakes were collected on a knit hat and shot almost
immediately. Multiple exposures were combined for each image (see
below). Lighting was natural and ISO was 800. Since this is a pretty
old camera, 800 means "rather grainy."

# Processing

The individual exposures were usable on their own, but I was curious
about using focus stacking to extend the depth of field so tried that.
I used commands like the following to first attempt to align multiple
shots. 

align_image_stack -v -a Out *.JPG

For each of the snowflakes below I had taken several dozen images. My
experience was that align_image_stack was unable to align most of the
images. Going through manually I picked off a few that looked well
aligned and restricted the focus-stacking step to them:

enfuse --exposure-weight=0 --saturation-weight=0 --contrast-weight=1 --hard-mask --verbose --output=output6207-27.tif Out00{27..28}.tif

After a cursory glance, I believe the focus stacking is doing the
following: For each position in the picture, it looks at how
dissimilar the corresponding pixel is from its neighbors for each of
the available frames. It then picks the pixel from the image with the
greatest dissimilarity under the assmption that this will correspond
to the sharpest focus. I then adjusted the light curves in the
gimp. This helped get rid of some weird halo effects that were visible
in some of the original images.

# Optics and magnification

By taking a picture of a ruler, I have determined that the setup
consisting of a 50mm lens + 65mm of extension tubes results in a
resolution of about 160 pixels/mm at minimum focus. So the snowflakes
in the above images are about 5-6mm in diameter. I now want to go
through the relevant formulas to understand better what is going on.

The minimum focus distance of the lens 

https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/camera-lenses/af-s-nikkor-50mm-f%252f1.8g.html

is given as $450$ mm. Note that this is the distance from the sensor
plane rather than from the front of the lens. We know that
$\frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{f}$ where $f_1$ is the
distance from the lens to the object; $f_2$ is the distance from the
lens to the focal plane; and $f$ is the focal length of the lens. (We
are approximating the complicated camera lens by a thin lens and
ignoring details such as nodal points.) If the object is at infinity,
then $f_2=50$ mm --- this is the "closest" the lens needs to be to the
focal plane. On the other hand, at the minimum focus distance of $450$
mm, one can compute that $f_2=57$ mm while $f_1 = 390$ mm. (For this
computationn, we solve the two equations $\frac{1}{f_1} +
\frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{50}$ and $450 = f_1 + f_2$.) I guess this
means there is effectively $7$ mm of travel available for focusing, which
sounds reasonable, but I haven't tried to measure it on the lens.

The extension tubes I have are labeled $7$ mm, $14$ mm and $28$
mm. When stacked, this yields $49$ mm. However, there is an additional
$16$ mm of adapter that must be used, giving a total extension of $65$
mm. When all the tubes are used, the maximum value of $f_2$ becomes
$65$ mm + $57$ mm = $122$ mm. Plugging back in to our formula yields a
minimum value of $f_1=85$ mm, yielding a minimum focus distance of
$122 + 85 = 207$ mm. From the [wikipedia page for
magnification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification), we see
that the reproduction ratio is the distance to the sensor plane
divided by the distance to the object. In our case, that yields a
reproduction ratio of $122/85 = 1.44x$. This means that, if you
imagine the actual image of the object overlaid onto the image sensor,
it has been enlarged to 144\% of its original size.

We can check the reproduction ratios by taking pictures of objects of
known size at minimum focus distances. I didn't do it carefully for
the bare lens, but did indeed find that I could fit a little over 6"
of a ruler in the frame. This is about right. With all of the
extension tubes on, I could fit in 5/8". None of the values I've
measured have been particularly precise, so I'm not surprised there's
a moderate discrepancy. When I first made the computation I forgot to
include the extra $16$ mm from the extension-tube adapter and got a
wildly different computed value from what I was seeing. When
measuring, one helpful value for the camera body is the flange focal
distance which, for the Nikon D200, is $46.50$ mm.

The D200 has a crop sensor whose width is $23.6$ mm. This is about
$15.6$ mm which suggests a reproduction ratio of
$23.6/15.6=1.51x$. This is not far off from our computed value above
and agrees with the results of this
[calculator](http://extreme-macro.co.uk/extension-tubes/#calculator).

# Other formulas

Apparently one can also compute the increase in magnification by
simply adding the length of the extension divided by the focal length
of the lens. In our case, the increase is $65/50=1.3$ yielding a final
reproduction ratio of $0.15 + 1.3 = 1.45x$. I haven't really absorbed
this formula, but seems plausible.

# Close-up Lens Filters

You can buy "filters" to place on the front of the lens to add
additional magnification. These are expressed in diopters $D$ with the
focal length being $1000/D$ mm. According to [this
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up_lens), when focused at
the minimal focusing distance $X$, the magnification increases by a
factor of $DX+1$ when a lens of diopter $D$ is added. For my bare $50$
mm lens, the minimum focus distance is $0.45$ meters, so a $+4$
diopter lens would increase the magnification by a factor of
2.8. Since the original magnification is $0.15x$, we end up at
$0.42x$, which is not particularly good. With the $65$ mm of extension
tubes, the minimum focus distance is $207$ mm.
