# Satellite transit of sun.

We tried to capture a solar transit of a satellite with an
apparent size of 2.4 arc-seconds. To be honest, I thought this would
be too small to see, but the sky was clear and it seemed like a good
opportunity to get more practice in. According to calsky, the transit
was to take about 0.7 seconds and occur right around 2:43:20.7 pm EDT.

We estimated that the satellite would move about 1 arc-second in
1/3000-th of a second. I used my 50mm lens on my Nikon D200 @ ISO 1600
for 1/4000-th of a second at f/8.0. This gave a pretty dim image, but
was a perfectly reasonable histogram. Using the higher f-stop seemed
to fix the camera focus issues. The entire rim of the sun looks to be
in focus. The sun was not perfectly centered in the telescope and you
can see what I assume is slight vignetting on the lower left due to
this. A moderate-sized sunspot can be seen top middle.

The below image consists of a number of stacked frames. You can see
dead pixels from the camera that aren't perfectly aligned among the
various frames.
