# August 21, 2017 Solar Eclipse

<p>
This is a picture of the August 21 total solar eclipse as viewed from
Rexburg, Idaho. Totality lasted for approximately 2 minutes and 15
seconds. The partial eclipse ran from about 10:15am to 12:57pm. The
pinhole image captured about an hour on either side of first and
fourth contacts.

It is a pinhole image created using a 16oz soda can duct-taped to the
roof rack of our rental car. The image was projected onto black and
white photo paper that was then scanned. The color has not been
adjusted though brightness and contrast have. The exposure was about
five hours. The necessarily short exposure did not allow for any real
foreground detail to be recorded. Reflections within the can as well
as banding from the scanner are both visible.
