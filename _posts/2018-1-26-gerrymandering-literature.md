This post is an attempt to keep track of various research articles
pertaining to the quantification of gerrymandering. Year is
approximate (year of preprint, publication? who knows).

For the most part I stick to peer-reviewed academic articles, although
there are a number of papers in law reviews --- which, to my
understanding, are typically not peer-reviewed in the traditional
academic sense --- as well as a few high-profile projects/reports. For
each paper I've read I add a brief, subjective description of its
importance/point to help me remember the paper. Your mileage may vary.
Of course, many articles could be placed under more than one category.

Feel free to suggest papers to be added.

* [The efficiency gap does not satisfy the efficiency principle](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1801.05301)
  Ellen Veomett, 2018

  The claim of the title is illustrated with an example election *for
  districts with different numbers of votes*. It does highlight the
  issue of there being two closely related versions of the efficiency
  gap (assuming equal numbers of votes in each district vs. not making
  this assumption) that are both often referred to by the same
  name. What's also interesting is that the ''more accurate'' version
  of the EG is the one that doesn't necessarily satisfy the efficiency
  principle.

* [Measuring political gerrymandering](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1801.02541)
  Kristopher Tapp, 2018

  This is a (mostly) expository note on the efficiency gap and some of
  its variations. I think it concludes that Nagle's *relative EG* is a
  better version than the original definition, but I haven't read the
  paper closely.

# 2017

* [Measuring efficiency in redistricting](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3007401)
  Eric McGhee, 2017 [Added 01.26.18]

  McGhee examines a number of measures (symmetry, mean-median,
  computer simulations, EG and variations) according to the extent to
  which they satisfy the Efficiency Principle.

* [Gerrymandering and the net number of US House seats won due to vote-distribution asymmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08681)
  Jeff Buzas and Gregory S. Warrington, 2017 [Added 01.26.18]

  This paper has two parts. First, using the
  [declination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09393) metric, it estimates
  the net number of US House seats won due to gerrymandering. Second,
  it critiques the technique used by
  [Chen-Cottrell](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/gerrymandering.pdf)
  and
  [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/)
  for similar estimates as not appropriate. See this [blog
  post](https://gswarrington.github.io/gerrymandering/2018/01/26/fivethirtyeight-seats.html) or [this one](http://electionlawblog.org/?p=94161) for details of the critique.

* [Quantifying gerrymandering using the vote distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09393)
  Gregory S. Warrington, 2017 [Added 01.26.18]

  This paper introduces a new measure of partisan asymmetry in
  district plans called the declination. It attempts to quantify how
  hard each side works to win the seats they do. While in the same
  spirit as the efficiency gap, it does not reduce to any notion of
  proportionality. The paper analyzes state and House elections going
  back to the 1970s.

# 2016

* [Evaluating partisan gains from Congressional gerrymandering: Using
computer simulations to estimate the effect of gerrymandering in the
U.S. House](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/gerrymandering.pdf)
  Jowei Chen and David Cottrell [Added 01.26.18]

  This paper simulates House district plans across the country in
  order to estimate the number of seats won by each party. They
  conclude that the difference of the current (enacted) plan from the
  median simulated plan is about one seat. Jeff Buzas and I critique
  the methodology in [this
  preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08681). We do not analyze
  their technique for simulating plans.
