# Academic articles

This post is an attempt to keep track of various research articles
pertaining to the quantification of gerrymandering. Broadly speaking,
I break these into three categories:
* Compactness metrics
* Symmetry metrics
* Computer simulations

For the most part I stick to peer-reviewed academic articles, although
there are a number of papers in law reviews (which, to my
understanding, are typically not peer-reviewed in the traditional
academic sense) as well as a few high-profile projects/reports. For
each paper I add a brief, subjective description of its
importance/point to help me remember the paper. Your mileage may vary.
Of course, many articles could be placed under more than one category.

Feel free to suggest papers to be added.

## Symmetry metrics

* []()

* [Gerrymandering and the net number of US House seats won due to vote-distribution asymmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08681)
  Jeff Buzas and Gregory S. Warrington
  Added 01.26.18

  This paper has two parts. First, using the
  [declination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09393) metric, it estimates
  the net number of US House seats won due to gerrymandering. Second,
  it critiques the technique used by
  [Chen-Cottrell](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/gerrymandering.pdf)
  and
  [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/)
  for similar estimates as not appropriate. See this [blog
  post](https://gswarrington.github.io/gerrymandering/2018/01/26/fivethirtyeight-seats.html) or [this one](http://electionlawblog.org/?p=94161) for details of the critique.

* [Quantifying gerrymandering using the vote distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09393)
  Gregory S. Warrington
  Added 01.26.18

  This paper introduces a new measure of partisan asymmetry in
  district plans called the declination. It attempts to quantify how
  hard each side works to win the seats they do. While in the same
  spirit as the efficiency gap, it does not reduce to any notion of
  proportionality. The paper analyzes state and House elections going
  back to the 1970s.

## Computer simulations

* [Evaluating partisan gains from Congressional gerrymandering: Using
computer simulations to estimate the effect of gerrymandering in the
U.S. House](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/gerrymandering.pdf)
  Jowei Chen and David Cottrell
  Added 01.26.18

  This paper simulates House district plans across the country in
  order to estimate the number of seats won by each party. They
  conclude that the difference of the current (enacted) plan from the
  median simulated plan is about one seat. Jeff Buzas and I critique
  the methodology in [this
  preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08681). (We do not analyze
  their technique for simulating plans.)
