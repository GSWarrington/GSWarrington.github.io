# Manual tracking of ISS

There was a bright ISS pass on Nov. 29 at about 5:30pm EST. Stellarium
lists a maximum magnitude of -3.1 and Calsky lists a maximum magnitude
of -3.8 with an angular velocity of 0.86 deg/sec. I tried tracking
manually with my 8" dob; the path was well suited for this going from
SW to NE with a maximum altitude of about 50 degrees.

Tracking with my 5 deg FOV finder scope was surprisingly easy. I had
no trouble keeping the ISS near the center of the field. My camera FOV
is (very) roughly 10' x 15' so I intentionally took pictures
off-center to allow for misalignment of the finder scope.

My camera is a Nikon D200 attached via a t-ring and a 2x barlow. It
does not have live view, so precise focusing is tricky. If I'd had
more time I might have tried a Bahtinov mask, but given circumstances
I focused on the moon. I intended to take my ISS pictures at 1/1600 of
a second and ISO 1600, but beforehand exposed the moon at 1/500 for
focusing purposes. Unfortunately, I forgot to change back to 1/1600
before shooting the ISS. This led to blurring, but it's hard to know
how much better they would have been with a shorter exposure given the
imprecise focusing. The images were certainly bright enough.

Here are the images with no processing.

Here they are with the curves adjusted slighly.

For next time I will
* Work ahead of time to get focusing precise.
* Take at a shorter exposure.
* Not start taking photos until closer overhead. Here I started taking
  too many when it was still far away and low in the sky. This filled
  up the camera's buffer and it didn't have time to recover so when I
  had the best chance for a shot I was limited in how many I could take.
* Make sure finder alignment is perfect so that there is no need to
  intentionally take ones off center to ensure capture.
