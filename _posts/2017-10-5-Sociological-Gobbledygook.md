# Sociological Gobbledygook

Chief Justice Roberts made his view of the efficiency gap crystal
clear during [oral arguments in Gill
v. Whitford](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/16-1161_bpm1.pdf),
argued on October 3.  First he dismissed quantitative measures of
gerrymandering:

> No, but you're going to take this --- the whole point is you're
> taking these issues away from democracy and you're throwing them
> into the courts pursuant to, and it may be simply my educational
> background, but I can only describe as sociological
> gobbledygook.

Then he claimed that use of the efficiency gap would damage the
reputation of the Supreme Court.

> Well, why did the Democrats win?  And the answer is going to be

> party X wasted votes minus the sigma of party Y wasted votes over

These statements lay bare both a misunderstanding of the utility of
mathematics and his own prejudice. Math and statistics provide a
language for dealing with situations in a quantitative manner. There
are costs to using such a language --- notably the difficulty of
translating between the math and standard english. But when faced with
a problem having quantitative features, it seems wise to use the tools
one has available.

Perhaps Chief Justice Roberts is comfortable with the use of math and
statistics in constitutional law in certain instances --- I am not
familiar enough with his work to say. But his above comments make me
think that and difference in his treatment of mathematics is more
likely due to the unevenness of his own 'educational background' than to
any substantive differences in the appropriateness of the
applications.

His second comment is just as
problematic. [Apparently](http://news.gallup.com/poll/4732/supreme-court.aspx),
the intelligent man (or woman) on the street is already as likely to
distrust the Supreme Court as to trust it. And while his logical
reasoning in *Shelby County v. Holder* or *Citizens United v. FEC* may be
constitutionally sound, what I understand of the reasoning sounds like
baloney to me. If someone took the time to carefully explain his
reasoning, I might end up agreeing with his argument. Similarly, if he
bothered to define "sigma of party X wasted votes", the man on the
street might not think of it as so much baloney.

So if Chief Justice Roberts doesn't think the efficiency gap has been
sufficiently researched, or he disagrees with its premises, or he
thinks it has too much uncertainty to useful, then he should say
so. But to dismiss it all as gobbledygook is simply a disservice.

Aside: I love how the elderly Justice Alito uses ageism to try to
discredit the efficiency gap.
