Sunday night was clear and cold (about 0 degrees F) and a perfect
opportunity to try taking a picture of the Orion Nebula through my
telescope using my recently completed equatorial platform. The
platform seems to work pretty well for visual observation in that it
roughly tracks objects with even minimal alignment. I've been curious
if it would track well enough for me to take photographs through my
telescope. I made a feeble attempt to do this a few nights ago that
failed miserably. With a little more experience aligning the platform,
I had better luck tonight.

Below is a 10 second exposure of the Orion Nebula taken through my 8"
dobsonian sitting on my equatorial platform. I used a Nikon D200 at
ISO 1600 through a 2x Barlow (necessary to obtain focus). The
trapezium --- the four clustered stars in the center have a diameter
of about 20 arc-seconds (1/3 of an arc-minute). The earth rotates at
about 15 arc-minutes/minute or 1 arc-minute every 4 seconds or 150
arc-seconds every 10 seconds. So during the course of this exposure,
with no tracking the trapezium would've moved about 7-8 times its own
diameter. So the tracking really is making a difference here.

Unfortunately, the tracking rate of the scope doesn't appear to be
consistent. There was trailing for most exposures at 10 seconds and
even for shorter ones. Of course, once you get down to about half of
a second you can probably get away with no tracking at all. Such a
short exposure is enough for newer cameras with usable ISOs of 25600,
but not for my camera. 

Some things to do:
- Devise a way to easily check during the day how consistent the
  platform's rotation is.
- Add in a button and display to manually change platform speed.
- 

The 6 mm and 3 mm masks lead to ballparks of about f/9 and f/18,
respectively. These a little over 3 stops and a little over 5 stops,
respectively. Below are three shots taken with various aperatures to
test the DOF. These were taken in bright sunlight from an angle of
about 45 degrees to the tape measure. Camera was at minimum focus
distance. From top to bottom, they are: wide open (f/2.8), 6 mm mask
(f/9) and 3 mm mask (f/18).

I should note that the cardboard masks I made were put on the front of
the lens. Perhaps there is some correction I need to make for this
since the focus distance is so close, but I don't know it and I
optimistically assume it's relatively minor, so will ignore that.

To my eye, there are about 1/16" in reasonably crisp focus for the 3mm
mask, about 1/32" for the 6mm mask and a about 1/64" for the 17 mm
(i.e., no) mask. (Of course, since we're viewing the tape at a 45
degree angle, the absolute DOFs are about 70 percent of these depths.)
But stopping down the lens doesn't simply increase the range that's in
relatively crisp focus, it also slows down the rate at which the focus
deteriorates outside of this range. I suppose this isn't surprising,
but it is important. At 3mm, you can discern the tick marks across the
whole range. With no mask, you can follow the tick marks for at most
one-third of what's visible.

Next time I take snowflake pictures I will definitely try the
masks. Probably just the 6mm one since I'm not sure I'll be able to
easily get enough light on the subject for the 3mm mask. I roughly
matched the amount of light collected under the three scenarios. For
the 3mm mask, I needed 1/100 of a second; for the 6mm mask I needed
about 1/400 of a secon; and for no mask, I needed 1/1600 of a
second. This is at least in the ballpark of what you'd expect from the
aperatures.
